# Motivation and Explanation

Originally, I created the planets simulation for my own benefit and fun.
I had just been on a course at work about python and it somewhat inspired me to move beyond the tasks I had been given and start coding something just because I wanted to.
I thought it would be quite a neat thing to do and not a particuarly massive challenge, maybe I could even show it to other people!

I succeeded in what I wanted to do, although along the way I found out [just how small planets are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_MZ8tda_1I)!
Then, I thought that it might be a good tool to demonstrate code to people.
Everyone knows what the solar system looks like, so why not have your own little model on a computer?

It should be pointed out that I am not an expert programmer.
Just like many others, I am constantly learning and trying to improve how I think about and write code.
So I thought this project would also be a good way to document some of my thoughts and methodologies.
They say you never truly understand something until you explain it to someone else, so this is my test!

## Is this tutorial different?

Along the way to the final model, I will try and explain not only what the code is and how it works, but why small steps are being taken.
Nobody sits down and writes good software in one fell swoop.
Especially when working with something new - whether that be an unfamiliar package or an entirely new language - it is necessary to break a problem down to its smallest and simplest components.
This allows understanding of what is actually going on, rather than what you think is going on or what somebody tells you is going on.

I am aiming to provide a full working program at each step of this tutorial.
They won't all look like a solar system, but they will address one part of the problem.
Hopefully, it will then become clear why the final program looks the way it does.
